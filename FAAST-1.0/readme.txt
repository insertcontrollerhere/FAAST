Developed by at the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies in collaboration with Belinda Lange, Skip Rizzo, David Krum, and Mark Bolas.

FAAST is free to use and distribute. However, you must still abide by the licensing terms of any third party software you install for skeleton tracking (either OpenNI software or Microsoft Kinect for Windows).  Please see the websites of these libraries for more information.

If you use FAAST to support your research project, we request that any publications resulting from the use of this software include a reference to the toolkit.  Additionally, we encourage you to send us an email about your project, so we can compile a list of projects that use FAAST. This will be help us pursue funding to maintain the software and add new functionality.  The publication to reference is:

E. Suma, B. Lange, A. Rizzo, D. Krum, and M. Bolas, "FAAST: The Flexible Action and Articulated Skeleton Toolkit," Proceedings of IEEE Virtual Reality, pp. 247-248, 2011.

Please see the project website for installation and usage instructions.  This development version of FAAST is currently available for Windows only.


Version History
---------------

1.0
- Complete rewrite of toolkit
- Support for Microsoft and OpenNI trackers
- Configuration of VRPN streaming for up to 4 users
- New interface for building custom gestures

0.10
- Upgraded to OpenNI version 1.5.2.23
- Upgraded to NITE version 1.5.2.21

0.09
- Upgraded to OpenNI version 1.3.2.3
- Upgraded to NITE version 1.4.1.2

0.08
- Upgraded OpenNI version to 1.1.0.41
- Upgraded NITE version to 1.3.1.5
- Removed sensor resolution settings, since this is now set automatically by OpenNI.
- Added capability to save/load calibration files.
- Added a new key_type event

0.07
- Mouse control has been removed from the action list, and is now configured using a GUI.
- Mouse control is more sophisticated, and now can be controlled using the hands without calibration (using a focus gesture).
- Multiple monitor support for absolute mouse control.
- Smoothing on skeleton joints and hand positions. This allows for much more precise mouse control.
- Multiple skeleton tracking modes: full body, upper body only, and lower body only
- Ability to save calibration to memory and load to different users.
- New actions: body_turn, crouch
- The following output events are now supported: key_press, key_hold, mouse_click, mouse_double_click, mouse_hold
- Actions can also be bound to the following FAAST control events: pause, resume, stop
- Tooltips that explain various GUI functions and parameters.

0.06
Added mouse support.  Fixed issue with keyboard events not being registered in games that use DirectInput.  Also removed key_special command; special keys now all have their own plain text keywords instead of having to use virtual key codes.

0.05
Minor bugfix release to fix compability with OpenNI's new Kinect drivers.  Changed skeleton joint units in VRPN from millimeters to meters, in order to fit with the VRPN standard.  Please note that if you are upgrading from an older version you will need to uninstall your current version of OpenNI, NITE, and the sensor driver, and then reinstall them using the new versions listed on our website.

0.04
Added support for 10 new actions, including jump, walk, and directional foot poses.  Fixed sensor initialization so that FAAST won't crash if the sensor is not hooked up or NITE is configured incorrectly.

0.03
Initial public release.
